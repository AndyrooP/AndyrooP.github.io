I'm stuck on a Morin problem.

Consider a semi-infinite stick (one that extends infinitely in one direction) with a linear mass density \\(\rho(x)\\). The stick enjoys the property that it can be cut anywhere, have a fulcrum placed at a distance \\(b\\) away from the cut, and balance on the fulcrum. Find \\(\rho(x)\\).

Here is what I have so far.

Suppose that the end of the stick is at \\(x=0\\). Let a cut be made at \\(x=c\\). Then, the fulcrum is placed at \\(x=c+b\\). Balancing torques about the fulcrum:
\\[\int_{c}^{c+b}{(c+b-x)\rho(x)\textrm{ d}x}=\int_{c+b}^{\infty}{(x-c-b)\rho(x)\textrm{ d}x}\\]
This can be rearranged to:
\\[\int_{c}^{\infty}{(c+b-x)\rho(x)\textrm{ d}x}=0\\]
This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation" target="_blank">integral equation</a>. I have no ideas as to how to solve it. I refuse to look at the solution just yet.
