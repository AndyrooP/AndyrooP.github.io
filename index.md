I am a third year PhD student in the <a href="https://math.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="https://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> studying under <a href="https://sawon.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Justin Sawon</a>. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, San Diego</a> in 2023. You can find my CV <a href="/bay/assets/docs/GCV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

​I am broadly interested in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. More specifically, I am interested in complex geometry, Hodge theory, algebraic topology, and interactions between these areas.

My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number" target="_blank">Erdös number</a> is 5.
