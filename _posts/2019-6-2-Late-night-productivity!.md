It's almost 3:00 AM and I've just solved problem 17 in *100 Geometry Problems* using only synthetic techniques! And boy is it pretty!

I emphasize using synthetic techniques because it's prettier and also the squares seem suggest that there's some sort of analytic method.

I'll write up the solution in the morning! Feels good to be back in a groove. Geez.
