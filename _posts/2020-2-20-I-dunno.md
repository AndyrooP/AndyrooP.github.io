Here is something I never thought about.

Additivity *and* homogeneity are conditions for a linear transformation for a reason. That is, it's possible for a function to be homogeneous but not additive and to be additive but not homogeneous. For example, consider \\(\varphi\colon\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(\varphi(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}\\). This is homogeneous but not additive.

Alternatively, for \\(\varphi\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\\), we can consider the map \\(a+bi\mapsto b+ai\\). This is additive but not homogeneous! In fact, it can be shown that an additive but not homogeneous function exists \\(\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\\), though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_functional_equation#Existence_of_nonlinear_solutions_over_the_real_numbers" target="_blank">the proof</a> is nonconstructive and uses the axiom of choice.

Meanwhile, I learned the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra just a few weeks ago. Very tricky, but very interesting. If anything I think I can get a cool diagram out of it.
