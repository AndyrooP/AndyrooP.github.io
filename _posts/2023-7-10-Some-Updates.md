I have finished my undergraduate degree at UCSD. I will begin my PhD at UNC Chapel Hill next month. My interests are roughly in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. My last year at UCSD was crucial in shaping these interests. At UNC, I am tentatively planning on working with <a href="https://sawon.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Justin Sawon</a>. Overall, I am glad that I was able to learn math for the last four years at UCSD and I look forward to continuing the journey at UNC.

As for the rest of this summer, I plan on reviewing some stuff that I've learned in the past few years to be relatively prepared for some of the comprehensive exams. Time-permitting, I will write up some important results here.
